# RoboExpDataAnalysis

This repository includes a Python Jupyter Notebook file that loads, processes and statistically analyzes the data from a robot programming study that looks at the effect of testing prototypes early during the development phase and was conducted by Achim Gerstenberg at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in 2017/18. The purpose of this GitHub repository is to provide researchers the necessary ressources to understand and retrace the performed data analysis.

These resources are accompanied by academic publications that were presented at the CIRP Design Conference in Porto in 2019.
For privacy reasons I cannot include the raw data. If you need additional information and if you are intersted in working with the data analysis file please contact me under Achim.Gerstenberg@ntnu.no.

The documentation of the experimental setup is available at https://github.com/AchimGerstenberg/RoboExpSetup.
